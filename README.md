# lsmft.pl

This project is a simple Perl script that prints out the Food trucks selling Tacos in San Francisco.  Data is pulled from a public data source provided by the city of San Francisco.  

Most of my work is behind NDL's from my clients.  I wrote this script as part of a job interview.  Not much to it, just an exercise in Perl programming, but it was fun...and I was finally able to use the standout 50's TV ad slogan, "LSMFT".  In this context of course, it simply means: "list Mexican food trucks".


    USAGE:   ./lsmft.pl
