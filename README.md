# lsmft.pl

This project is a simple Perl script that prints out the Food trucks selling Tacos in San Francisco.  Data is pulled from a public data source provided by the city of San Francisco.

Not much to the script, just an exercise in Perl programming, but it was fun to do.  ...And I was finally able to use the standout 50's TV ad slogan, "LSMFT".  In this context of course, it simply means: "list Mexican food trucks".


    USAGE:   ./lsmft.pl
